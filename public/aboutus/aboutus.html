<b>Mission Statement:</b>
</br>IKEA Social is the brain child of IBM-IKEA leadership team. We realized with time the necessity of a social site to get to know each other as we are collaborating from different parts of the world. Although we use different communication channels like email, phone, chat etc. this Platform gives us the chance to know more about our co-workers, be essential to each other and eventually helps create one globally integrated team. Our aim is to incorporate further functionalities to this portal to the level where it can be utilised for all social interaction within the IKEA-IBM team.
